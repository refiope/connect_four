-This section really tested my patience. Usually when I code, I start things right away by making classes and methods. After writing a method I test them by loading the file into irb. So I code first, then test, then code, then test and so on. Initially, the idea of making tests first then coding to make the tests pass seemed stupid, and I thought about skipping this part three times while reading tutorials on rspec. Now that I have somewhat done it, I see the merit. I only used a couple of methods from rspec, but doing it the TDD way made me deal with bugs a lot less than I usually deal with in the past. I was really surprised when I made everything weave together (I ended my TDD way of coding at this point), things worked out right away with no bugs to get rid of. I have to be honest though, it seemed like it took more time than it would have taken if I did it my way (or it may be just my imagination). Also, my small knowledge of rspec also restricted the limit on how to code this program. Anyways, this was a good experience
